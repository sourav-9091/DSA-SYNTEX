Hash function consist of two parts

1. Hash code -> It creates a hash code but not neccsarrily of bucket size 
2. Compression function -> It takes the hash code and convert it into bucket size

Lets say for the string "abc" the hash code could be the sum of the ascii value and then pass it through the compression function 
then it will become bucket size
